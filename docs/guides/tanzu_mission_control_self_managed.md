# Beyond SaaS: Tanzu Mission Control Self-Managed

Tanzu Mission Control Self-Managed offers a packaged deployment model for Kubernetes fleet management. Because it is deployed in your own infrastructure, you can run this service in an air-gapped environment. Organizations in highly regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and government can benefit from centralized Kubernetes management while meeting compliance and data sovereignty requirements.
