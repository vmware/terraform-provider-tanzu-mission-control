    Adding the node pool resource to a cluster.

# Provisioning node pool on a cluster

For clusters that you create in Tanzu Mission Control, you can define a pool of worker nodes on which your workloads can run.
By default, each workload cluster that you create through Tanzu Mission Control has a node pool.
The `tanzu-mission-control_cluster_node_pool` resource allows you to create additional node pools, as well as read, update, and delete existing node pools in your clusters.
Because Tanzu Mission Control cannot provision additional resources in a cluster that is created elsewhere and subsequently attached, you cannot create a node pool in an attached cluster.

For provisioning of a cluster, refer to the `tanzu-mission-control_cluster` in guides.
For creating nodepool on the created cluster, one can use dependency in the terraform script.

You could create/manage a `node pool` for a cluster with the following config which shows a node pool resource with dependency on a TKGs cluster:

```terraform
/*
  NOTE: Creation of node pool depends on cluster creation
*/

terraform {
  required_providers {
    tanzu-mission-control = {
      source = "vmware/tanzu-mission-control"
    }
  }
}
