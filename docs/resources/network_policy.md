# Managing Network Communication for Your Clusters

Define how pods communicate using network policies.

Using VMware Tanzu Mission Control, you can create a network policy that defines how pods communicate with each other and other network endpoints, using preconfigured templates called recipes.
By default, Tanzu Mission Control does not impose any such restriction, and allows you to manage network restrictions at the organizational level and at the workspace level.

Tanzu Mission Control implements network policies using Kubernetes native network policies. Each namespace and workspace can be governed by a network policy, and these policies are inherited down through the organizational hierarchy.
Network policies are additive, both inherited and direct network policies are applied and are effective on your namespaces according to Kubernetes rules.

For more information about Kubernetes native network policies, see [Network Policies][network-policies] in the Kuberenetes documentation.
For more information about policy inheritance in Tanzu Mission Control, see [Policy-Driven Cluster Management][policy-driven-cluster-management] in VMware Tanzu Mission Control Concepts.

## Input Recipe

In the Tanzu Mission Control network policy resource, there are currently eight system defined types of network policy recipes that you can use:

- **allow-all**
- **allow-all-to-pods**
- **allow-all-egress**
- **deny-all**
- **deny-all-to-pods**
- **deny-all-egress**
- **custom-egress**
- **custom-ingress**

## Policy Scope and Inheritance

In the Tanzu Mission Control resource hierarchy, there are two levels at which you can specify network policy resource:
- **organization** - `organization` block under `scope` sub-resource
- **object groups** - `workspace` block under `scope` sub-resource

In addition to the direct policy defined for a given object, each object has inherited policies described in the parent objects. For example, a namespace has inherited policies from the workspace and organization to which it is linked.

**Note:**
The scope parameter is mandatory in the schema and the user needs to add one of the defined scopes to the script for the provider to function.
Only one scope per resource is allowed.

## Rules in Network Policies

Some of the network policy recipes allow you to provide a rule that uses a set of criteria to identify the target locations with which to permit or restrict communication, and the port on which they can communicate.
The criteria used in these rules can include the following types:

- IP range (allow and exclude)
- label selector (pods and namespaces)
- port and protocol

You can define multiple criteria of a given type in a single rule, and use these criteria in combination with each other.
The location criteria (IP range and label selector) that you define are specific to the template that you are using.
For the custom-ingress template, you identify sources from which to allow traffic; and for the custom-egress template, you identify destinations to which to allow traffic.

If you do not specify any location criteria, the policy does not restrict traffic by location.
All sources or destinations are allowed. Likewise, if you do not specify any ports, all ports are allowed.

### IP Range Criteria

When you specify a range for allowed IP addresses, traffic is permitted on all IP addresses in that range.
You can also optionally exclude a range of IP addresses within the allowed range.

If you specify multiple IP ranges for a given location, the location must match any one of the criteria.
For example, if you define three allowed IP ranges, traffic is allowed to (or from) locations within any one of the three ranges.

### Label Selector Criteria

If you specify multiple label selectors for a given type, the location must match any one of the criteria to allow traffic.
For example, if you define three pod selectors, traffic is allowed to (or from) pods that have a label matching any one of the three selectors.

If you specify a location using both the pod selector and the namespace selector in a single location definition, then both must be satisfied.

### Port Criteria

The port and protocol fields allow you to specify a port on which to allow traffic, and the protocol that the traffic must use.
You can specify multiple ports, and each one must have a corresponding protocol. The port can be either a numerical or named port.

If you specify multiple ports, the channel must match any one of the criteria to allow traffic.
For example, if you define three ports, traffic is allowed through any one of the three ports.
