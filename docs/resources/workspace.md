# Workspace

Group namespaces together into a workspace for more efficient management using this Terraform module.

The workspace is an organizational tool that helps you monitor and manage your Kubernetes namespaces within and across clusters.
Workspaces allow you to organize your managed namespaces into logical groups across clusters, perhaps to align with development projects.

To create a workspace, you must have `organization.edit` permissions in Tanzu Mission Control.
For more information, please refer [create a Workspace.][workspace]
