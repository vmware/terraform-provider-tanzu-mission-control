    Creating the Tanzu Kubernetes image registry policy resource.

# Managing Access to Image Registries

Define the registries from which images can be pulled for deployment in your managed namespaces.

Using VMware Tanzu Mission Control, you can make the deployments to namespaces in your clusters more secure by restricting the image registries from which images can be pulled,
as well as the images that can be pulled from a registry.
By default, Tanzu Mission Control does not impose any such restriction,
and allows you to manage image registry restrictions at the organizational level and at the workspace level.

Each namespace and workspace can be protected by an image registry policy that defines the registries from which an image can be pulled,
and these policies are inherited down through the organizational hierarchy.
For more information, see [Policy-Driven Cluster Management][policy-driven-cluster-management] in VMware Tanzu Mission Control Concepts.

[policy-driven-cluster-management]: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/services/tanzumc-concepts/GUID-847414C9-EF54-44E5-BA62-C4895160CE1D.html

## Input Recipe

In the Tanzu Mission Control image policy resource, there are four system defined types of image policy recipes that you can use:
- **allowed-name-tag** - The Name-Tag allowlist recipe allows you to create rules using an image name or tag name or both.
- **block-latest-tag** - The Block latest tag recipe prevents the use of images that are tagged latest.
- **custom** - The Custom recipe allows you to create rules using multiple factors.
- **require-digest** - The Require Digest recipe prevents the use of images that do not have a digest.

## Policy Scope and Inheritance

In the Tanzu Mission Control resource hierarchy, there are two levels at which you can specify image policy resource:
- **organization** - `organization` block under `scope` sub-resource
- **object groups** - `workspace` block under `scope` sub-resource

In addition to the direct policy defined for a given object, each object has inherited policies described in the parent objects. For example, a namespace has inherited policies from the workspace and organization to which it is linked.

**Note:**
The scope parameter is mandatory in the schema and the user needs to add one of the defined scopes to the script for the provider to function.
Only one scope per resource is allowed.

## Workspace scoped Allowed-name-tag Image Policy

### Example Usage

```terraform
/*
Workspace scoped Tanzu Mission Control image policy with allowed-name-tag input recipe.
This policy is applied to a workspace with the allowed-name-tag configuration option.
The defined scope and input blocks can be updated to change the policy's scope and recipe, respectively.
*/

  name = "tf-image-test"

  scope {
    workspace {
      workspace = "tf-workspace"
    }
  }

  spec {
    input {
      allowed_name_tag {
        audit = true
        rules {
          imagename = "bar"
          tag {
            negate = true
            value = "test"
          }
        }
      }
    }

    namespace_selector {
      match_expressions {
        key      = "component"
        operator = "In"
        values = [
