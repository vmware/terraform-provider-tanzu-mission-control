# Package Repository

This resource allows you to read Package from a cluster through Tanzu Mission Control.

The Available tab on the Catalog page in the Tanzu Mission Control console shows the packages that are available to be installed, including those that are in the Tanzu Standard package repository and other repositories that you have associated with a cluster.
