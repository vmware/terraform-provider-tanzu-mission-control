# EKS Cluster

The `tanzu-mission-control_ekscluster` resource allows you to provision and manage [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) through Tanzu Mission Control.
It allows users to connect Tanzu Mission Control to their Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and create, update/upgrade, and delete EKS clusters and node groups (called node pools in Tanzu).

## Provisioning an EKS Cluster

To use the **Tanzu Mission Control** for creating a new cluster, you must first connect your AWS account to Tanzu Mission Control.
For more information, see [connecting an AWS account for EKS cluster lifecycle management][aws-account]
and [create an EKS Cluster][create-cluster].

You must also have the appropriate permissions in Tanzu Mission Control:

- To provision a cluster, you must have `cluster.admin` permissions.
- You must also have `clustergroup.edit` permissions on the cluster group in which you want to put the new cluster.
