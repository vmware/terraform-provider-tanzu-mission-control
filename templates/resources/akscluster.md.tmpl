# AKS Cluster

The `tanzu-mission-control_akscluster` resource allows you to provision and manage [Azure AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service) through Tanzu Mission Control.
It allows users to connect Tanzu Mission Control to their Microsoft Azure account and create, update/upgrade, and delete AKS clusters and node groups (called node pools in Tanzu).

## Provisioning a AKS Cluster

To use the **Tanzu Mission Control** for creating a new cluster, you must first log into Azure and set up an Azure AKS
credential that allows VMware Tanzu Mission Control to connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources in your
Azure account. For more information, see [connecting an Azure account for AKS cluster lifecycle management][azure-account]
and [create an AKS Cluster][create-cluster].

You must also have the appropriate permissions in Tanzu Mission Control:

- To provision a cluster, you must have `cluster.admin` permissions.
- You must also have `clustergroup.edit` permissions on the cluster group to detach a cluster.

__Note__: Fields under the [nested Schema for `spec.nodepool`](#nestedblock--spec--nodepool) which are marked as "immutable" can't be changed. To update those fields, you need to create a new node pool or rename the node pool (which will have the same effect).

## Minimal Example Usage

All keys other than those under 'meta' are required.
