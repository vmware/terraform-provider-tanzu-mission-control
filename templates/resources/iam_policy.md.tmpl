# IAM Policy

The `tanzu-mission-control_iam_policy` resource allows you to add, update, and delete role bindings to a particular scope for identity and access management through Tanzu Mission Control.

IAM policy (also known as Access Management) allows you to implement role-based access control (RBAC) in Tanzu Mission Control. For more information, see [Access Control.][access-control]

[access-control]: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/services/tanzumc-concepts/GUID-EB9C6D83-1132-444F-8218-F264E43F25BD.html

## Policy Scope and Inheritance

In the Tanzu Mission Control resource hierarchy, there are three levels and five object types at which you can specify IAM policy resources:
- **organization** - `organization` block under `scope` sub-resource
- **object groups** - `cluster_group` or `workspace` block under `scope` sub-resource
- **Kubernetes objects** - `cluster` or `namespace` block under `scope` sub-resource

In addition to the direct policy defined for a given object, each object has inherited policies described in the parent objects. For example, a cluster has a direct policy and inherited policies from the cluster group and organization to which it is attached.
Similarly, a namespace has a direct policy and inherited policies from the workspace with which it is associated.

**Note:**
The scope parameter is mandatory in the schema and the user needs to add one of the defined scopes to the script for the provider to function.
Only one scope per resource is allowed.

## Managing Access to Your Resources

To use the **Tanzu Mission Control provider** for adding, editing, and removing role bindings, you must define who has access to each resource in your organization using role-based access control.
For more information, see [Managing Access to Resources.][managing-access]
