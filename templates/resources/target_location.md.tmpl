# Target Location (Backup Location) Resource

This resource enables users to create and configure target locations for data protection backups.
Once created, a target location can be used to store cluster backups.

**NOTE**: The type of a target location is inherited from the configured credentials type which can be either "TMC Managed" or "Self Managed".

For more information regarding target location, see [Target Location][target-location].
