# Helm Feature

The `tanzu-mission-control_helm_feature` resource allows you to enable and disable [helm feature][helm-feature] to a particular scope through Tanzu Mission Control.

When you enable the Helm service on a cluster or cluster group, you can then create releases in your cluster from Helm charts stored in the Bitnami repository.
To enable a helm service, you must be associated with the cluster.admin or clustergroup.admin role.

## Helm Feature Scope

In the Tanzu Mission Control resource hierarchy, there are two levels at which you can specify Helm Feature resources:
- **object groups** - `cluster_group` block under `scope` sub-resource
- **Kubernetes objects** - `cluster` block under `scope` sub-resource

**Note:**
The scope parameter is mandatory in the schema and the user needs to add one of the defined scopes to the script for the provider to function.
Only one scope per resource is allowed.
