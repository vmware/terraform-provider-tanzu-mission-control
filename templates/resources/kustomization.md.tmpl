## Kustomization Scope

In the Tanzu Mission Control resource hierarchy, there are two levels at which you can specify Kustomization resources:
- **object groups** - `cluster_group` block under `scope` sub-resource
- **Kubernetes objects** - `cluster` block under `scope` sub-resource

**Note:**
The scope parameter is mandatory in the schema and the user needs to add one of the defined scopes to the script for the provider to function.
Only one scope per resource is allowed.
