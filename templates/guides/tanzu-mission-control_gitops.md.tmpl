# Defining Gitops

This feature will allow cluster admins to attach git repositories to their cluster or cluster groups ,
and sync folders in the repo to the cluster. Repositories may or may not require authentication.

The `tanzu-mission-control_git_repository` enables the Continuous Delivery feature on cluster or cluster group level scope.

# Terraform Resources for Gitops

## Git Repository

The `tanzu-mission-control_git_repository` resource allows you to add, update, and delete git repository to a particular scope through Tanzu Mission Control.

Git repositories are used to store kustomizations that will be synced to your cluster.

Please refer to [Add a Git Repository to a Cluster or Cluster Group.][git-repository]

## Kustomization

The `tanzu-mission-control_kustomization` resource allows you to add, update, and delete Kustomization to a particular scope through Tanzu Mission Control.

In Creation of kustomization we must required to create Git Repository first, which we need to referenced in spec of kustomization, Git Repository can be created by using "tanzu-mission-control_git_repository" resource from terraform provider itself.

Please refer to [Add a Kustomization to a Cluster or Cluster Group.][kustomization]

[kustomization]: https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/standalone-components/tanzu-mission-control/1-4/tanzu-mission-control-documentation/tanzumc-using-GUID-99916A6D-5DAF-4A26-88C7-28662F847F2F.html

## Repository Credential

The `tanzu-mission-control_repository_credential` resource allows you to add, update, and delete repository credential to a particular scope through Tanzu Mission Control.

Repository credentials are used to authenticate to Git repositories and must be created before adding your Git repository.

Please refer to [Create a Repository Credential for a Cluster or Cluster Group.][repository-credential]

To Create these resources you must be associated with the cluster.admin or clustergroup.admin role.
