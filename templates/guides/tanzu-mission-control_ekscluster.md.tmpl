# EKS Cluster

The `tanzu-mission-control_ekscluster` resource can directly perform cluster lifecycle management operations on EKS clusters (and associated node groups) including create, update, upgrade, and delete through Tanzu Mission Control.

## Prerequisites

To manage the lifecycle of EKS clusters, you need the following prerequisites.

- Onboard the AWS account onto Tanzu Mission Control under which the EKS Clusters will be provisioned. Please refer [connecting an AWS account for EKS cluster lifecycle management][aws-account] guide for detailed steps. You can also use `tanzu-mission-control_credential` Terraform resource for this purpose. The name of the EKS AWS credential in Tanzu Mission Control will be reffered to as `credential_name` in this guide.

- Create the required VPC with subnets in the desired region. Please refer to Tanzu documentation on how to [create a VPC with Subnets for EKS cluster lifecycle management][tanzu-vpc-guide] and AWS guide for [creating a VPC for your Amazon EKS cluster][aws-vpc-guied].

- Ensure the CSP token used in initialising the terraform provider has the right set of permissions to create a workload cluster.

## Provisioning the cluster

You can use the following template as reference to write your own `tanzu-mission-control_ekscluster` resource in the terraform scripts.
